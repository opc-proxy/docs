Requirements
=============


This library is written in C#, so you would need to install Microsoft .Net Core framework on your device.
This is really only needed if you want to write a custom OPC-Proxy, in which case you would need to build the library 
into an executable, but most of the times the already provided standalone application would do just fine.

.. note::
    By far the easiest way to get up and running is using our docker image of the standalone application.

In case you want to build your own custom application you would need the following:

- Install .NET Core >= 2.2  following the description `here <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download>`_
- Install Git
